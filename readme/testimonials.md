# Testimonials

"I've got to say I'm loving it so far. I'm using it today to verify what SPDL would look like if we used last frame's reprojected probe sample data (as part of a thought experiment on how we can make the algorithm more mobile-friendly). Rearranging the nodes to achieve this in Gigi was a breeze and took me minutes, whereas I would have probably spent hours on updating the plumbing in Unreal."

"I used gigi yesterday to prototype some post processing. I just grabbed some rendertarget png files from RenderDoc, then plugged them in as input to gigi. It was way faster to get it set up and learn how to use it than it would have been for me to set the same thing up in Unity."

*-- Tommy Walton*

"I had always wanted to try experimenting with some compute shaders, but the overhead involved in setting up an environment that could run them was too big of a hurdle. Gigi changed all of that, and made it really easy to write some shader code, hook it up to some test inputs, and see the results instantly." 

*-- Andrew Steadman, Electronic Arts*

"Gigi has quickly become my favorite tool for prototyping and learning GPU programming, as it is very user friendly and fun to use. Growing up with RenderMonkey, FX Composerwith a fond memory, I see Gigi as a modernized version of these wonderful tools, and I'm looking forward to see it grow even further."
