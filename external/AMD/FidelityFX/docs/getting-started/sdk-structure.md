<h1>FSR™ SDK Structure</h1>

The AMD FSR™ SDK consists of several main components, organized to ensure a good experience when exploring and learning about the techniques implemented in the SDK.

The core components that ultimately ship with your application are separated for convenient integration into your project's source code.

<h2>AMD FSR™ SDK</h2>

<h3>Includes</h3>

The SDK contains everything needed to ship all of our FSR™ effects in your application:

- Host-side includes for all of our effect components, which represent the pre-built easy to use library for easier effect integration.
- A limited collection of HLSL shaders, which represent some of the pre-built library GPU code executed as part of the binary.

<h3>Libraries and DLLs</h3>

A collection of pre-built runtime libraries to automate the usage of the FSR™ SDK and make integration as simple as possible.

<h2>Docs</h2>

A collection of detailed Markdown documents.
