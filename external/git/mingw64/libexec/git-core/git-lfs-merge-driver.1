.SH "NAME"
git-lfs-merge-driver \- Merge text\-based LFS files
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\f(CRgit lfs merge\-driver\fP [options]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Merge text files stored in Git LFS using the default Git merge
machinery, or a custom merge driver if specified. Note that this, in
general, does not support partial renames or copies because Git does not
support them in this case.
.sp
This program is intended to be invoked automatically by Git and not by
users manually. See CONFIGURATION for details on the configuration
required for that.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\f(CR\-\-ancestor <path>\fP
.RS 4
Specify the file containing the ancestor revision.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-current <path>\fP
.RS 4
Specify the file containing the current revision.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-marker\-size <num>\fP
.RS 4
Specify the conflict marker size as an integer.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-other <path>\fP
.RS 4
Specify the file containing the other revision.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-program <program>\fP
.RS 4
Specify a command, which is passed to the shell after substitution, that
performs the actual merge. If this is not specified, \f(CRgit merge\-file\fP is
invoked with appropriate arguments to perform the merge of the file.
.sp
See CONFIGURATION for the sequences which are substituted here.
.RE
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.sp
Git allows the use of a custom merge driver for files based on the
\f(CRmerge\fP attribute set in \f(CR.gitattributes\fP. By default, when using
\f(CRgit lfs track\fP, this value is set to \f(CRlfs\fP.
.sp
Because Git LFS can be used to store both text and binary files and it
isn\(cqt always clear which behavior should be used, Git LFS does not
enable this merge driver by default. However, if you know that some or
all of your files are text files, then you can set the \f(CRmerge\fP attribute
for those files to \f(CRlfs\-text\fP and use \f(CRgit config\fP to set the merge
driver like so:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
$ git config merge.lfs\-text.driver \*(Aqgit lfs merge\-driver \-\-ancestor %O \-\-current %A \-\-other %B \-\-marker\-size %L \-\-output %A\*(Aq
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
This tells Git to invoke the custom Git LFS merge driver, which in turn
uses Git\(cqs merge machinery, to merge files where the \f(CRmerge\fP attribute
is set to \f(CRlfs\-text\fP. Note that \f(CRlfs\-text\fP here is an example and any
syntactically valid value can be used.
.sp
If you are using a special type of file that needs rules different from
Git\(cqs standard merge machinery, you can also specify the \f(CR\-\-program\fP
option, which is passed to \f(CRsh\fP after substituting its own
percent\-encoded escapes:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR%A\fP: the current version
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR%B\fP: the other version
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR%D\fP: the destination version
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR%O\fP: the ancestor version
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR%L\fP: the conflict marker size
.RE
.sp
Note that the percent sign must typically be doubled to prevent Git from
substituting its own values here. Therefore, specifying the default
behavior explicitly looks like this:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
$ git config merge.lfs\-text.driver \(rs
  \*(Aqgit lfs merge\-driver \-\-ancestor %O \-\-current %A \-\-other %B \-\-marker\-size %L \-\-output %A \-\-program \*(Aq\(rs\*(Aq\*(Aqgit merge\-file \-\-stdout \-\-marker\-size=%%L %%A %%O %%B >%%D\*(Aq\(rs\*(Aq\*(Aq\*(Aq
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
The exit status from the custom command should be zero on success or
non\-zero on conflicts or other failure.
.sp
Note that if no merge driver is specified for the value of the \f(CRmerge\fP
attribute (as is the case by default with \f(CRmerge=lfs\fP), then the default
Git merge strategy is used. For LFS files, this means that Git will try
to merge the pointer files, which usually is not useful.
