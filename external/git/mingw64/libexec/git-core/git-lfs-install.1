.\}
.el \{\

.\}
Install a pre\-push hook to run git\-lfs\-pre\-push(1) for the current
repository, if run from inside one. If "core.hooksPath" is configured in
any Git configuration (and supported, i.e., the installed Git version is
at least 2.9.0), then the pre\-push hook will be installed to that
directory instead.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
Without any options, \f(CRgit lfs install\fP will only setup the "lfs" smudge
and clean filters if they are not already set.
.sp
\f(CR\-\-force\fP
.RS 4
Sets the "lfs" smudge and clean filters, overwriting existing values.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-local\fP
.RS 4
Sets the "lfs" smudge and clean filters in the local repository\(cqs git config,
instead of the global git config (~/.gitconfig).
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-worktree\fP
.RS 4
Sets the "lfs" smudge and clean filters in the current working tree\(cqs git
config, instead of the global git config (~/.gitconfig) or local repository\(cqs
git config ($GIT_DIR/config). If multiple working trees are in use, the Git
config extension \f(CRworktreeConfig\fP must be enabled to use this option. If only
one working tree is in use, \f(CR\-\-worktree\fP has the same effect as \f(CR\-\-local\fP.
This option is only available if the installed Git version is at least 2.20.0
and therefore supports the "worktreeConfig" extension.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-manual\fP
.RS 4
Print instructions for manually updating your hooks to include git\-lfs
functionality. Use this option if \f(CRgit lfs install\fP fails because of existing
hooks and you want to retain their functionality.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-system\fP
.RS 4
Sets the "lfs" smudge and clean filters in the system git config, e.g.
/etc/gitconfig instead of the global git config (~/.gitconfig).
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-skip\-smudge\fP
.RS 4
Skips automatic downloading of objects on clone or pull. This requires a
manual "git lfs pull" every time a new commit is checked out on your
repository.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-skip\-repo\fP
.RS 4
Skips installation of hooks into the local repository; use if you want to
install the LFS filters but not make changes to the hooks.  It is valid to use
\f(CR\-\-local\fP, \f(CR\-\-global\fP, or \f(CR\-\-system\fP in conjunction with this option.
