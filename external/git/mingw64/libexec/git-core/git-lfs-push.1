.SH "NAME"
git-lfs-push \- Push queued large files to the Git LFS endpoint
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\f(CRgit lfs push\fP [options] <remote> [<ref>...]
.br
\f(CRgit lfs push\fP <remote> [<ref>...]
.br
\f(CRgit lfs push\fP [options] <remote> \-\-stdin
\f(CRgit lfs push\fP \-\-object\-id <remote> [<oid>...]
\f(CRgit lfs push\fP \-\-object\-id <remote> \-\-stdin
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Upload Git LFS files to the configured endpoint for the current Git
remote. By default, it filters out objects that are already referenced
by the local clone of the remote.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\f(CR\-\-dry\-run\fP
.RS 4
Print the files that would be pushed, without actually pushing them.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-all\fP
.RS 4
This pushes all objects to the remote that are referenced by any commit
reachable from the refs provided as arguments. If no refs are provided, then
all local refs are pushed. Note that this behavior differs from that of
git\-lfs\-fetch(1) when its \f(CR\-\-all\fP option is used; in that case, all refs are
fetched, including refs other than those under \f(CRrefs/heads\fP and \f(CRrefs/tags\fP.
If you are migrating a repository with these commands, make sure to run \f(CRgit
lfs push\fP for any additional remote refs that contain Git LFS objects not
reachable from your local refs.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-object\-id\fP
.RS 4
This pushes only the object OIDs listed at the end of the command, separated
by spaces.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-stdin\fP
.RS 4
Read a list of newline\-delimited refs (or object IDs when using \f(CR\-\-object\-id\fP)
from standard input instead of the command line.
