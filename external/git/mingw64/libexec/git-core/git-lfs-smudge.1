.SH "NAME"
git-lfs-smudge \- Git smudge filter that converts pointer in blobs to the actual content
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\f(CRgit lfs smudge\fP [<path>]
.br
\f(CRgit lfs smudge\fP \-\-skip [<path>]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Read a Git LFS pointer file from standard input and write the contents
of the corresponding large file to standard output. If needed, download
the file\(cqs contents from the Git LFS endpoint. The argument, if
provided, is only used for a progress bar.
.sp
Smudge is typically run by Git\(cqs smudge filter, configured by the
repository\(cqs Git attributes.
.sp
In your Git configuration or in a \f(CR.lfsconfig\fP file, you may set either
or both of \f(CRlfs.fetchinclude\fP and \f(CRlfs.fetchexclude\fP to comma\-separated
lists of paths. If \f(CRlfs.fetchinclude\fP is defined, Git LFS pointer files
will only be replaced with the contents of the corresponding Git LFS
object file if their path matches one in that list, and if
\f(CRlfs.fetchexclude\fP is defined, Git LFS pointer files will only be
replaced with the contents of the corresponding Git LFS object file if
their path does not match one in that list. Paths are matched using
wildcard matching as per gitignore(5). Git LFS pointer files that are
not replaced with the contents of their corresponding object files are
simply copied to standard output without change.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
Without any options, \f(CRgit lfs smudge\fP outputs the raw Git LFS content to
standard output.
.sp
\f(CR\-\-skip\fP
.RS 4
Skip automatic downloading of objects on clone or pull.
.RE
.sp
\f(CRGIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE\fP

.RE
.SH "KNOWN BUGS"
.sp
On Windows, Git before 2.34.0 does not handle files in the working tree
larger than 4 gigabytes. Newer versions of Git, as well as Unix
versions, are unaffected.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.sp
