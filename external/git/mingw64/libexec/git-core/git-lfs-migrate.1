.SH "NAME"
git-lfs-migrate \- Migrate history to or from Git LFS
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\f(CRgit lfs migrate\fP <mode> [options] [\-\-] [branch ...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Convert files in a Git repository to or from Git LFS pointers, or
summarize Git file sizes by file type. The \f(CRimport\fP mode converts Git
files (i.e., blobs) to Git LFS, while the \f(CRexport\fP mode does the
reverse, and the \f(CRinfo\fP mode provides an informational summary which may
be useful in deciding which files to import or export.
.sp
In all modes, by default \f(CRgit lfs migrate\fP operates only on the
currently checked\-out branch, and only on files (of any size and type)
added in commits which do not exist on any remote. Multiple options are
available to override these defaults.
.sp
When converting files to or from Git LFS, the \f(CRgit lfs migrate\fP command
will only make changes to your local repository and working copy, never
any remotes. This is intentional as the \f(CRimport\fP and \f(CRexport\fP modes are
generally "destructive" in the sense that they rewrite your Git history,
changing commits and generating new commit SHAs. (The exception is the
"no\-rewrite" \f(CRimport\fP sub\-mode; see IMPORT WITHOUT REWRITING HISTORY
for details.)
.sp
You should therefore always first commit or stash any uncommitted work
before using the \f(CRimport\fP or \f(CRexport\fP modes, and then validate the
result of the migration before pushing the changes to your remotes, for
instance by running the \f(CRinfo\fP mode and by examining your rewritten
commit history.
.sp
Once you are satisfied with the changes, you will need to force\-push the
new Git history of any rewritten branches to all your remotes. This is a
step which should be taken with care, since you will be altering the Git
history on your remotes.
.sp
To examine or modify files in branches other than the currently
checked\-out one, branch refs may be specified directly, or provided in
one or more \f(CR\-\-include\-ref\fP options. They may also be excluded by
prefixing them with \f(CR^\fP or providing them in \f(CR\-\-exclude\-ref\fP options.
Use the \f(CR\-\-everything\fP option to specify that all refs should be
examined, including all remote refs. See INCLUDE AND EXCLUDE REFERENCES
for details.
.sp
For the \f(CRinfo\fP and \f(CRimport\fP modes, all file types are considered by
default; while useful in the \f(CRinfo\fP mode, this is often not desirable
when importing, so either filename patterns (pathspecs) or the \f(CR\-\-fixup\fP
option should normally be specified in that case. (At least one include
pathspec is required for the \f(CRexport\fP mode.) Pathspecs may be defined
using the \f(CR\-\-include\fP and \f(CR\-\-exclude\fP options (\f(CR\-I\fP and \f(CR\-X\fP for short),
as described in INCLUDE AND EXCLUDE.
.sp
As typical Git LFS usage depends on tracking specific file types using
filename patterns defined in \f(CR.gitattributes\fP files, the
\f(CRgit lfs migrate\fP command will examine, create, and modify
\f(CR.gitattributes\fP files as necessary. The \f(CR.gitattributes\fP files will
always be assigned the default read/write permissions mode (i.e.,
without execute permissions). Any symbolic links with that name will
cause the migration to halt prematurely.
.sp
The \f(CRimport\fP mode (see IMPORT) will convert Git objects of the file
types specified (e.g., with \f(CR\-\-include\fP) to Git LFS pointers, and will
add entries for those file types to \f(CR.gitattributes\fP files, creating
those files if they do not exist. The result should be as if
\f(CRgit lfs track\fP commands had been run at the points in your Git history
corresponding to where each type of converted file first appears. The
exception is if the \f(CR\-\-fixup\fP option is given, in which case the
\f(CRimport\fP mode will only examine any existing \f(CR.gitattributes\fP files and
then convert Git objects which should be tracked by Git LFS but are not
yet.
.sp
The \f(CRexport\fP mode (see EXPORT) works as the reverse operation to the
\f(CRimport\fP mode, converting any Git LFS pointers that match the file types
specified with \f(CR\-\-include\fP, which must be given at least once. Note that
\f(CR.gitattributes\fP entries will not be removed, nor will the files;
instead, the \f(CRexport\fP mode inserts "do not track" entries similar to
those created by the \f(CRgit lfs untrack\fP command. The \f(CR\-\-remote\fP option is
available in the \f(CRexport\fP mode to specify the remote from which Git LFS
objects should be fetched if they do not exist in the local Git LFS
object cache; if not provided, \f(CRorigin\fP is used by default.
.sp
The \f(CRinfo\fP mode (see INFO) summarizes by file type (i.e., by filename
extension) the total number and size of files in a repository. Note that
like the other two modes, by default the \f(CRinfo\fP mode operates only on
the currently checked\-out branch and only on commits which do not exist
on any remote, so to get a summary of the entire repository across all
branches, use the \f(CR\-\-everything\fP option. If objects have already been
converted to Git LFS pointers, then by default the size of the
referenced objects is totaled and reported separately. You may also
choose to ignore them by using \f(CR\-\-pointers=ignore\fP or to treat the
pointers as files by using \f(CR\-\-pointers=no\-follow\fP. (The latter option is
akin to how existing Git LFS pointers were handled by the \f(CRinfo\fP mode in
prior versions of Git LFS).
.sp
When using the \f(CR\-\-everything\fP option, take note that it means all commits
reachable from all refs (local and remote) will be considered, but not
necessarily all file types. The \f(CRimport\fP and \f(CRinfo\fP modes consider all file
types by default, although the \f(CR\-\-include\fP and \f(CR\-\-exclude\fP options constrain
this behavior.
.sp
While the \f(CR\-\-everything\fP option means all commits reachable from any
ref will be considered for migration, after migration only local refs will
be updated even when \f(CR\-\-everything\fP is specified. This ensures remote
refs stay synchronized with their remote. In other words, \f(CRrefs/heads/foo\fP
will be updated with the \f(CR\-\-everything\fP option, but \f(CRrefs/remotes/origin/foo\fP
will not, so it stays in sync with the remote until \f(CRgit push origin foo\fP
is performed.  After checking that the results of a migration with
\f(CR\-\-everything\fP are satisfactory, it may be convenient to push all local
branches to your remotes by using the \f(CR\-\-all\fP option to \f(CRgit push\fP.
.sp
Unless the \f(CR\-\-skip\-fetch\fP option is given, \f(CRgit lfs migrate\fP always
begins by fetching updated lists of refs from all the remotes returned
by \f(CRgit remote\fP, but as noted above, after making changes to your local
Git history while converting objects, it will never automatically push
those changes to your remotes.

Note: Git refs are "case\-sensitive" on all platforms in "packed from"

\f(CR\-\-yes\fP
.RS 4
Assume a yes answer to any prompts, permitting noninteractive use. Currently,
the only such prompt is the one asking whether to overwrite (destroy) any

appended.
.RE
.SS "INFO"
.sp
The \f(CRinfo\fP mode summarizes the sizes of file objects present in the Git
history. It supports all the core \f(CRmigrate\fP options and these additional
ones:
.sp
\f(CR\-\-above=<size>\fP
.RS 4
Only count files whose individual filesize is above the given size. \f(CRsize\fP may
be specified as a number of bytes, or a number followed by a storage unit,
e.g., "1b", "20 MB", "3 TiB", etc.
.sp
If a set of files sharing a common extension has no files in that set
whose individual size is above the given \f(CR\-\-above\fP no files no entry for
that set will be shown.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-top=<n>\fP
.RS 4
Only display the top \f(CRn\fP entries, ordered by how many total files match the
given pathspec. The default is to show only the top 5 entries. When existing
Git LFS objects are found, an extra, separate "LFS Objects" line is output in
addition to the top \f(CRn\fP entries, unless the \f(CR\-\-pointers\fP option is used to
change this behavior.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-unit=<unit>\fP
.RS 4
Format the number of bytes in each entry as a quantity of the storage unit
provided. Valid units include: * b, kib, mib, gib, tib, pib \- for IEC storage
units * b, kb, mb, gb, tb, pb \- for SI storage units
.sp
If a \f(CR\-\-unit\fP is not specified, the largest unit that can fit the number
of counted bytes as a whole number quantity is chosen.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-pointers=[follow|no\-follow|ignore]\fP
.RS 4
Treat existing Git LFS pointers in the history according to one of three
alternatives. In the default \f(CRfollow\fP case, if any pointers are found, an
additional separate "LFS Objects" line item is output which summarizes the
total number and size of the Git LFS objects referenced by pointers. In the
\f(CRignore\fP case, any pointers are simply ignored, while the \f(CRno\-follow\fP case
replicates the behavior of the \f(CRinfo\fP mode in older Git LFS versions and
treats any pointers it finds as if they were regular files, so the output
totals only include the contents of the pointers, not the contents of the
objects to which they refer.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-fixup\fP
.RS 4
Infer \f(CR\-\-include\fP and \f(CR\-\-exclude\fP filters on a per\-commit basis based on the
\f(CR.gitattributes\fP files in a repository. In practice, this option counts any
filepaths which should be tracked by Git LFS according to the repository\(cqs
\f(CR.gitattributes\fP file(s), but aren\(cqt already pointers. The \f(CR.gitattributes\fP
files are not reported, in contrast to the normal output of the \f(CRinfo\fP mode.
This option is incompatible with explicitly given \f(CR\-\-include\fP, \f(CR\-\-exclude\fP
filters and with any \f(CR\-\-pointers\fP setting other than \f(CRignore\fP, hence \f(CR\-\-fixup\fP
implies \f(CR\-\-pointers=ignore\fP if it is not explicitly set.
.RE
.sp
The format of the output shows the filename pattern, the total size of
the file objects (excluding those below the \f(CR\-\-above\fP threshold, if one
was defined), and the ratio of the number of files above the threshold
to the total number of files; this ratio is also shown as a percentage.
For example:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
*.gif               93 MB   9480/10504 files(s)  90%
*.png               14 MB    1732/1877 files(s)  92%
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
By default only the top five entries are shown, but \f(CR\-\-top\fP allows for
more or fewer to be output as desired.
.SS "IMPORT"
.sp
The \f(CRimport\fP mode migrates objects present in the Git history to pointer
files tracked and stored with Git LFS. It supports all the core
\f(CRmigrate\fP options and these additional ones:
.sp
\f(CR\-\-verbose\fP
.RS 4
Print the commit oid and filename of migrated files to STDOUT.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-above=<size>\fP
.RS 4
Only migrate files whose individual filesize is above the given size. \f(CRsize\fP
may be specified as a number of bytes, or a number followed by a storage unit,
e.g., "1b", "20 MB", "3 TiB", etc. This option cannot be used with the
\f(CR\-\-include\fP, \f(CR\-\-exclude\fP, and \f(CR\-\-fixup\fP options.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-object\-map=<path>\fP
.RS 4
Write to \f(CRpath\fP a file with the mapping of each rewritten commits. The file
format is CSV with this pattern: \f(CROLD\-SHA\fP,\f(CRNEW\-SHA\fP
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-no\-rewrite\fP
.RS 4
Migrate objects to Git LFS in a new commit without rewriting Git history.
Please note that when this option is used, the \f(CRmigrate import\fP command will
expect a different argument list, specialized options will become available,
and the core \f(CRmigrate\fP options will be ignored.

.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-fixup\fP
.RS 4
Infer \f(CR\-\-include\fP and \f(CR\-\-exclude\fP filters on a per\-commit basis based on the
\f(CR.gitattributes\fP files in a repository. In practice, this option imports any
filepaths which should be tracked by Git LFS according to the repository\(cqs
\f(CR.gitattributes\fP file(s), but aren\(cqt already pointers. This option is
incompatible with explicitly given \f(CR\-\-include\fP, \f(CR\-\-exclude\fP filters.
.RE
.sp
If \f(CR\-\-no\-rewrite\fP is not provided and \f(CR\-\-include\fP or \f(CR\-\-exclude\fP (\f(CR\-I\fP,
\f(CR\-X\fP, respectively) are given, the \f(CR.gitattributes\fP will be modified to
include any new filepath patterns as given by those flags.
.sp
If \f(CR\-\-no\-rewrite\fP is not provided and neither of those flags are given,
the gitattributes will be incrementally modified to include new filepath
extensions as they are rewritten in history.
.SS "IMPORT WITHOUT REWRITING HISTORY"
.sp
The \f(CRimport\fP mode has a special sub\-mode enabled by the \f(CR\-\-no\-rewrite\fP
flag. This sub\-mode will migrate objects to pointers as in the base
\f(CRimport\fP mode, but will do so in a new commit without rewriting Git
history. When using this sub\-mode, the base \f(CRmigrate\fP options, such as
\f(CR\-\-include\-ref\fP, will be ignored, as will those for the base \f(CRimport\fP
mode. The \f(CRmigrate\fP command will also take a different argument list. As
a result of these changes, \f(CR\-\-no\-rewrite\fP will only operate on the
current branch \- any other interested branches must have the generated
commit merged in.
.sp
The \f(CR\-\-no\-rewrite\fP sub\-mode supports the following options and
arguments:
.sp
\f(CR\-m <message>\fP, \f(CR\-\-message=<message>\fP
.RS 4
Specifies a commit message for the newly created commit.
.RE
.sp
[file ...]
.RS 4
The list of files to import. These files must be tracked by
patterns specified in the gitattributes.
.RE
.sp
If \f(CR\-\-message\fP is given, the new commit will be created with the
provided message. If no message is given, a commit message will be
generated based on the file arguments.
.SS "EXPORT"
.sp
The \f(CRexport\fP mode migrates Git LFS pointer files present in the Git
history out of Git LFS, converting them into their corresponding object
files. It supports all the core \f(CRmigrate\fP options and these additional
ones:
.sp
\f(CR\-\-verbose\fP
.RS 4
Print the commit oid and filename of migrated files to
STDOUT.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-object\-map=<path>\fP
.RS 4
Write to \f(CRpath\fP a file with the mapping of each rewritten commit. The file
format is CSV with this pattern: \f(CROLD\-SHA\fP,\f(CRNEW\-SHA\fP
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-remote=<git\-remote>\fP
.RS 4
Download LFS objects from the provided \f(CRgit\-remote\fP during the export. If not
provided, defaults to \f(CRorigin\fP.
.RE
.sp
The \f(CRexport\fP mode requires at minimum a pattern provided with the
\f(CR\-\-include\fP argument to specify which files to export. Files matching
the \f(CR\-\-include\fP patterns will be removed from Git LFS, while files
matching the \f(CR\-\-exclude\fP patterns will retain their Git LFS status. The
export command will modify the \f(CR.gitattributes\fP to set/unset any
filepath patterns as given by those flags.
.SH "INCLUDE AND EXCLUDE"
.sp
You can specify that \f(CRgit lfs migrate\fP should only convert files whose
pathspec matches the \f(CR\-\-include\fP glob patterns and does not match the
\f(CR\-\-exclude\fP glob patterns, either to reduce total migration time or to
only migrate part of your repo. Multiple patterns may be given using
commas as delimiters.
.sp
Pattern matching is done so as to be functionally equivalent to the
pattern matching format of \f(CR.gitattributes\fP. In addition to simple file
extension matches (e.g., \f(CR\fB.gif\fP) patterns may also specify directory
paths, in which case the \f(CRpath/\fP*\fP format may be used to match
recursively.
.sp
Note that this form of pattern matching for the \f(CR\-\-include\fP and
\f(CR\-\-exclude\fP options used by the \f(CRgit lfs migrate\fP command is unique
among the suite of \f(CRgit lfs\fP commands. Other commands which also take
these options, such as \f(CRgit lfs ls\-files\fP, use the gitignore(5) form of
pattern matching instead.
.SH "INCLUDE AND EXCLUDE REFERENCES"
.sp
You can specify that \f(CRgit lfs migrate\fP should only convert files added
in commits reachable from certain references, namely those defined using
one or more \f(CR\-\-include\-ref\fP options, and should ignore files in commits
reachable from references defined in \f(CR\-\-exclude\-ref\fP options.

the remote refs themselves will not be updated).
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.SS "Migrate unpushed commits"
.sp
A common use case for the migrate command is to convert large Git
objects to LFS before pushing your commits. By default, it only scans
commits that don\(cqt exist on any remote, so long as the repository is
non\-bare.
.sp
First, run \f(CRgit lfs migrate info\fP to list the file types taking up the
most space in your repository:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
$ git lfs migrate info
migrate: Fetching remote refs: ..., done
migrate: Sorting commits: ..., done
migrate: Examining commits: 100% (1/1), done
*.mp3   284 MB    1/1 files(s)  100%

*.csv   5.8 MB    2/2 files(s)  100%
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
Now, you can run \f(CRgit lfs migrate import\fP to convert some file types to
LFS:
.sp
.if n .RS 4

.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
If after conversion you find that some files in your working directory
have been replaced with Git LFS pointers, this is normal, and the
working copies of these files can be repopulated with their full
expected contents by using \f(CRgit lfs checkout\fP.
.SS "Migrate local history"
.sp
You can also migrate the entire history of your repository:
.sp
.if n .RS 4

The same flags will work in \f(CRimport\fP mode:

.if n .RE
.sp
Note: This will require a force\-push to any existing Git remotes. Using
the \f(CR\-\-all\fP option when force\-pushing may be convenient if many local refs
were updated, e.g., after importing to Git LFS with the \f(CR\-\-everything\fP
