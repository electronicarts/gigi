.SH "NAME"
git-lfs-track \- View or add Git LFS paths to Git attributes
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\f(CRgit lfs track\fP [options] [<pattern>...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Start tracking the given patterns(s) through Git LFS. The argument is
written to .gitattributes. If no paths are provided, simply list the
currently\-tracked paths.
.sp
The \c
.URL "https://git\-scm.com/docs/gitattributes" "gitattributes documentation"
states that patterns use the
.URL "https://git\-scm.com/docs/gitignore" "gitignore pattern rules" ""
to match
paths. This means that patterns which contain asterisk (\f(CR*\fP), question
mark (\f(CR?\fP), and the bracket characters (\f(CR[\fP and \f(CR]\fP) are treated
specially; to disable this behavior and treat them literally instead,
use \f(CR\-\-filename\fP or escape the character with a backslash.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\f(CR\-\-verbose\fP, \f(CR\-v\fP
.RS 4
If enabled, have \f(CRgit lfs track\fP log files which it will touch. Disabled by
default.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-dry\-run\fP, \f(CR\-d\fP
.RS 4
If enabled, have \f(CRgit lfs track\fP log all actions it would normally take
(adding entries to .gitattributes, touching files on disk, etc) without
performing any mutative operations to the disk.
.sp
\f(CRgit lfs track \-\-dry\-run [files]\fP also implicitly mocks the behavior of
passing the \f(CR\-\-verbose\fP, and will log in greater detail what it is
doing.
.sp
Disabled by default.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-filename\fP
.RS 4
Treat the arguments as literal filenames, not as patterns. Any special glob
characters in the filename will be escaped when writing the \f(CR.gitattributes\fP
file.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-lockable\fP, \f(CR\-l\fP
.RS 4
Make the paths \*(Aqlockable\*(Aq, meaning they should be locked to edit them, and
will be made read\-only in the working copy when not locked.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-not\-lockable\fP
.RS 4
Remove the lockable flag from the paths so they are no longer read\-only unless
locked.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-no\-excluded\fP
.RS 4
  Do not list patterns that are excluded in the output; only list patterns that
are tracked.
\-\-no\-modify\-attrs:
Makes matched entries stat\-dirty so that Git can re\-index files you wish to
convert to LFS. Does not modify any \f(CR.gitattributes\fP file(s).
