.SH "NAME"
git-lfs-pointer \- Build, compare, and check pointers
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\f(CRgit lfs pointer \-\-file=path/to/file\fP
.br
\f(CRgit lfs pointer \-\-file=path/to/file \-\-pointer=path/to/pointer\fP

\f(CRgit lfs pointer \-\-check \-\-file=path/to/file\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Builds and optionally compares generated pointer files to ensure
consistency between different Git LFS implementations.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\f(CR\-\-file\fP
.RS 4
A local file to build the pointer from.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-pointer\fP
.RS 4
A local file including the contents of a pointer generated from another
implementation. This is compared to the pointer generated from \f(CR\-\-file\fP.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-stdin\fP
.RS 4
Reads the pointer from STDIN to compare with the pointer generated from
\f(CR\-\-file\fP.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-check\fP
.RS 4
Reads the pointer from STDIN (if \f(CR\-\-stdin\fP is given) or the filepath (if
\f(CR\-\-file\fP) is given. If neither or both of \f(CR\-\-stdin\fP and \f(CR\-\-file\fP are given,
the invocation is invalid. Exits 0 if the data read is a valid Git LFS
pointer. Exits 1 otherwise.
.RE
.sp
\f(CR\-\-strict\fP, \f(CR\-\-no\-strict\fP
.RS 4
In conjunction with \f(CR\-\-check\fP, \f(CR\-\-strict\fP verifies that the pointer is
canonical; that is, it would be the one created by Git LFS. If it is not,
exits 2. The default, for backwards compatibility, is \f(CR\-\-no\-strict\fP, but this
may change in a future version.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.sp
Part of the git\-lfs(1) suite.
